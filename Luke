FYI

-Left off email and password on User model as devise took care of it after

- compared to our ERD, dont think image field needs to be added to the models

- at the moment when you go to /users/new it doesnt show email verication yet, but easy to fix, made comments in user controller to make sense of it

- some fields show up on login page that we dont want to show, will fix later

- left out verbal marks for now, easy to add after
